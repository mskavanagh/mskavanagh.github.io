Content is where the actual substance of the post will be rendered.

So if you have a markdown file that says "layout: post" in its frontmatter, the
first thing that will happen is it will replace the tag below with its processed
HTML.

But--if the layout file *also* has a layout tag in *its* frontmatter, then
everything that gets put together here ends up inside the content tag of
whatever layout it invoked.

So for example, if you have a post markdown file, and the post layout file uses
the home layout, it goes:

<HomeLayout>

  <PostLayout>

    <Post />

  </PostLayout>

</HomeLayout>

You can make up your own layouts though, and as long as they exist, Jekyll will
show whatever is specified in a layout. Not everything has to telescope all the
way back to the layout of the landing page, basically.
