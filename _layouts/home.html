      <p>
        Eyeshadodw 2600 FM is a part electronic, part retro, part EDM, part industrial musical project by me, Meryl S. Kavanagh, alongside my
        work in fiction and 3D modeling art/texture projects in Second Life. The musical outfit itself is being centered because the majority of my effort
        goes into this big thing I've created and I feel like it should be totally front and center.
